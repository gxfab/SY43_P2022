## Project description
### Name meaning
Our project is named Lafo_cheuse because this app goal is to allow the user to mow all of his wheat (based on a French pun : "wheat" in English is "bl√©" in French, which also means money)
The way Lafo is written comes from the word [*lafo*](http://dictionnaire.sensagent.leparisien.fr/lafo/mg-mg/#google_vignette), a Malagasy word used to talk about expensive items.
### Project goal
Create an Android budget managment app, using the Zero Based Budgeting method.
