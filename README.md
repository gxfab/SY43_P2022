## App purpose

This app allows the user to manage its budget with the Zero method.

It's made for young adults who are interested in tech and finance because we want to implement crypto and stocks features.


## Name choice

We came up with "MoneyZ" because the goal of the app is to finish the month at 0€. The Z stands for Zero.
