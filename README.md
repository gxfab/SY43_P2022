####  I) About
Group's name: Poets Starving Children Bleed<br/>
Coming from the well-known song of the formidable group: _21st Century Schizoid Man_<br/>
~~And also, it's way too long and annoying, which makes it the perfect name~~<br/></br>

Our android app is part of a project that aimed at managing your monthly budget, income and expenses without forgetting a single cent.</br></br>

#### II) How to use

##### Front Page

This page is purely informative. You can see what are your biggest spending  categories and where are you according to the budget set for a certain category.
</br>

##### Budget Page

This page shows you the different categories, as well as additional informations about them. You can sort the categories according to the different criterias. By selecting a category, you can see the list of its expenses and subcategories, as well as edit the category's properties. You can also do the same with subcategories and expenses.</br>
The categories' properties are the following:
- The category's name
- The budget allocated to the category
- The subcategory property (if the category is a subcategory of another category)
- The parent of the subcategory (if it is one)
</br>

##### Cash Flow Page

Here is the list of all expenses, that you can also sort and edit each entry just like in the previous page.</br>
Each expense has the following properties:
- The expense's name
- The date of the expense
- The expense's amount
- The expense's type (including classical expense, income (basically a positive expense), debt refund and savings)
- The expense's category
- The expense's stability (is it the same every month ? If yes, it will automatically be taken in account each month)</br>
The cash flow page also allows to distinguish one-time and stable expenses, as well as to show the expenses in the form of a graph.</br>

##### Debt/Savings page

At the end of each month, the amount that did not get spent is automatically ditribued to the debt and savings category.</br>
The debts are slowly refunded according to the time left to reimburse everything.</br>
What's left goes to the savings, which are categories allocated to your project you need to save money for.</br>
Just like on the other pages, you can sort the different categories according to several criterias.</br>

##### Creating your own categories and expenses

By using the button at the top right of the screen, you can add expenses and categories. By being on the debt screen, you can also add a new debt.
The process of filling in the informations is fairly easy as everything is labelled.</br></br></br>

We now hope you will be able to reach the end of your month without entering "survival mode".
